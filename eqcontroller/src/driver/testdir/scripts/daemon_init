# Check for master/slave status by executing a command to relay "0"
# on each of the boards. Start by writing a command "7" to board 7,
# a command "6" to board 6, etc.
# A command sent to relay "0" should result in an echo of the command
# when the card is read back.  (Note: the comand that was sent should
# appear in the lower 8 bits of the "ADC word".
# A board that is missing will return and ADC value of "FFF"
# Any card that returns its card number (for example, if card 7
# returns and ADC value of "07X" (where X is don't care)) is a
# master.  Any card that returns an ADCvalue of "00X" is a slave
# (except, of course, card 0 is required to be a master).
